    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Alisson, I am from Ecuador  and I am so happy to be part of this program!</p>
    <p>I am studying for the Software Deveopment BS because I really like technology and gaming and one of my goals is to become self reliant and a great programmer!</p> 
    <p>I work remotely for a solar panel company and I am so happy to have the opportunity to both study and work from home so I can help my family around the house and take care of my sister.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ for 10 years now and it has really made a huge impact in my life knowing that I am in the right path and I thank our Heavenly Father for always supporting me and helping me make the best decisions for my life and my future.</p> 
    <p>Looking forward to learning a lot and getting to know everyone. See you around!</p>
